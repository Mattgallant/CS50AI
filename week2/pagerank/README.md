<h1> Pagerank </h1>

This program (pagerank.py) implements an AI that ranks pages based on amount of links to a given page.
It implements both an <strong> Iterative </strong> and a <strong> "Random Surfer" sampling </strong> algorithim
to compute the relative page ranks of each HTML page provided in a folder.

To run pagerank.py: $python pagerank.py corpusname

This program was done as part of an assignment for Harvard's CS50AI class <strong> Week 2 </strong>
